# Model-based testing demo with XState

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but only for the bootstrapping. There's not actually an app to run

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- Run stopwatch tests `yarn test stopwatch`
- Run updated stopwatch tests `yarn test lap`
- Run dog tests `yarn test dog`
- Run victim tests `yarn test victim`

### Other commands

- `yarn start` but you just get a blank app telling you not to do anything ...
